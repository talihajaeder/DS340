# Driver Drowniness Detection 
Welcome to out DS 340 Final Project where we will cover the problem of preventing drowsy drivers. We will show how to use facial recognition to detect sleepy drivers. Car accidents are a common cause of human injury and death. Drowsy drivers are a major cause of car accidents. This project will detail an approach to create a drowsy driver detection system using computer vision. 

In this repo you will find phase 1 and phase 2 of our implementation and their results.
